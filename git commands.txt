1) git init in root folder
2) git status tells us which files are not added to git(untracked)
3)git add .
4) for individual folder-
    git add server.js
    syntax - git add 'filename'

5) make a file .gitignore 
this file will contain all the folders/files which we dont want git to track
they for our personal use

6) if we have already added something but we wanted to ignore it so we use command
. git rm -r --cached node_modules

7)git commit -m "Message"
this savves the snapshot of current state of project
